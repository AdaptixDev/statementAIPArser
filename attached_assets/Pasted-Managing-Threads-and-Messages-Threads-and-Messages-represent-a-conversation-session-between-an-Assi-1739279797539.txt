Managing Threads and Messages
Threads and Messages represent a conversation session between an Assistant and a user. There is a limit of 100,000 Messages per Thread. Once the size of the Messages exceeds the context window of the model, the Thread will attempt to smartly truncate messages, before fully dropping the ones it considers the least important.

You can create a Thread with an initial list of Messages like this:

thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Create 3 data visualizations based on the trends in this file.",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "file_id": file.id,
          "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
Messages can contain text, images, or file attachment. Message attachments are helper methods that add files to a thread's tool_resources. You can also choose to add files to the thread.tool_resources directly.

Creating image input content
Message content can contain either external image URLs or File IDs uploaded via the File API. Only models with Vision support can accept image input. Supported image content types include png, jpg, gif, and webp. When creating image files, pass purpose="vision" to allow you to later download and display the input content. Currently, there is a 100GB limit per project. Please contact us to request a limit increase.

Tools cannot access image content unless specified. To pass image files to Code Interpreter, add the file ID in the message attachments list to allow the tool to read and analyze the input. Image URLs cannot be downloaded in Code Interpreter today.

file = client.files.create(
  file=open("myimage.png", "rb"),
  purpose="vision"
)
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What is the difference between these images?"
        },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}
        },
        {
          "type": "image_file",
          "image_file": {"file_id": file.id}
        },
      ],
    }
  ]
